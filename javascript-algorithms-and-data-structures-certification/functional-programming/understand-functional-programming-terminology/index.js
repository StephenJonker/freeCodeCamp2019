// Goal: 
// Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in 
// tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that 
// the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function 
// as the first argument.

// Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. 
// We'll discuss this more in later lessons.

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
