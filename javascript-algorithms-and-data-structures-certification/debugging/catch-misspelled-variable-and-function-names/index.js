// Goal: 
// Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.

// Original code
//
// let receivables = 10;
// let payables = 8;
// let netWorkingCapital = recievables - payable;
// console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);

// Fixed code 
// 
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital IS: ${netWorkingCapital}` + " EXPECT 2");


// let result = "<tbd>"; 
// console.log("The value in variable result is: " + result + " Expect <tbd> ");

// EOF
