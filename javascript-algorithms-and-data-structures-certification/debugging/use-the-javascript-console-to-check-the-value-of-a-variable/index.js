// Goal: 
// Use the console.log() method to print the value of the variable "a" where noted in the code.

let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);


// let result = "<tbd>"; 
// console.log("The value in variable result is: " + result + " Expect <tbd> ");
