// Add two console.log() statements to check 
// the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log("Type of variable \'seven\' is: " + typeof(seven) );
console.log("Type of variable \'three\' is: " + typeof(three) );
