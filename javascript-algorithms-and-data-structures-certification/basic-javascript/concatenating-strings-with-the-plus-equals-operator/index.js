// Goal: 
// Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: 
// "This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." 
// using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is 
// shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, 
// then add on the second string.

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

console.log("The value in variable myStr is: " + myStr);

// EOF
