// Goal: 
// Initialize the three variables a, b, and c 
// with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

// Only change code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

console.log("The value in variable c is: " + c);
