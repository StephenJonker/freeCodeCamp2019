// Goal: 
// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were 
// to print it to the console, you would see:
// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line 

console.log("The value in variable myStr is: " + myStr);

// EOF
