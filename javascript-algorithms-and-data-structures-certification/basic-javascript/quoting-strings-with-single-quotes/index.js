// Goal: 
// Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.
// Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. 
// You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

console.log("The value in variable myStr is: " + myStr);

// EOF
